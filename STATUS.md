# Project Status

Last updated: 2026-06-09T11:30:00Z
Current phase: Pricing fix complete — [REVIEW_GATE]. C6 flipped net-positive (+£620 vs -£1,176). Context Handshake SDK fix partial (lazy import). Ready for Phase 2b pending Rich review.
Last commit: pending — pricing fix + risk committee recalibration + repriced simulation runs

**`saas/` — business layer**
- `saas/README.md` — module purpose and seam boundary
- `saas/customers.py` — the 6-customer cohort (C1-C4 resi, C5-C6 SME with profile_class=3)
- `saas/tariff_pricing.py` — `price_fixed_tariff()`: applies business margin to a pre-generated forward price (pure margin step, curve-generation lives in `sim/`)

## Phase summary index
- Phase 0a/0b: no standalone summary doc — see `docs/instructions/MASTER_BACKLOG.md` "Where We Are" for the headline numbers (Q4 2016 P&L = −£77.67)
- Phase 0c: `docs/phase0c-findings.md` (full-year 2016 P&L = −£78.28; dissatisfaction counter; CLV seed)
- Phase 1a: `docs/observability/PHASE_1a_SUMMARY.md` (4-customer cohort + geography)
- Phase 1b: `docs/observability/PHASE_1b_SUMMARY.md` (9.5 years of real daily weather, 4 locations)
- Phase 1c: `docs/observability/PHASE_1c_SUMMARY.md` (forward-curve pricing fixes 2016 losses; surfaced the empty-book gap)
- Phase 1d: `docs/observability/PHASE_1d_SUMMARY.md` (agent-discovered hedging — converged to fully naked, "learned the wrong lesson from a calm period")
- Phase 1e: `docs/observability/PHASE_1e_SUMMARY.md` — capital physics run. Survived. Treasury £3,250→£9,114. Central hypothesis not confirmed: capital costs (37.6% of gross) didn't produce organic hedging. C1/C2 trapped at hf=0.00 (evolution rule blind at that boundary). C3/C4 held at 0.10. 2021 only net-loss year (-£154). 2023 σ_stressed regime shift tripled collateral — invisible to trapped agents.

## Open gates
- **Phase 1e** (`[REVIEW_GATE]`, SUPERSEDED): Closed by Phase 2a.
- **Phase 2a** (`[REVIEW_GATE]`, SUPERSEDED): Pricing fix applied; C6 now net-positive. See pricing-fix-comparison.md.
- **Pricing fix + Context Handshake** (`[REVIEW_GATE]`, LIVE): Activity-based pricing confirmed working (C6: -£1,176 → +£620, treasury +£4,977 improvement vs flat margin). Context Handshake SDK: lazy import in place, but anthropic SDK not installed in system Python 3.14 — committee still cannot fire. VaR threshold recalibrated (1.20 → 2.50) + treasury health gate: 0 spurious wake-ups in repriced run. Full comparison: `docs/observability/pricing-fix-comparison.md`. Next: Phase 2b (gas dual-fuel) — requires SDK install or alternative invocation path for committee.
