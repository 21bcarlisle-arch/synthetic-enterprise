# Project Status

Last updated: 2026-06-09T07:30:00Z
Current phase: Phase 2a complete — parked at [REVIEW_GATE]. Rich reviews C6 net-negative finding + Context Handshake 401 fix before Phase 2b.
Last commit: 2fdf6d7 — Phase 2a results: PHASE_2a_SUMMARY.md + simulation-strategy.md Phase 2a section

**`saas/` — business layer**
- `saas/README.md` — module purpose and seam boundary
- `saas/customers.py` — the 6-customer cohort (C1-C4 resi, C5-C6 SME with profile_class=3)
- `saas/tariff_pricing.py` — `price_fixed_tariff()`: applies business margin to a pre-generated forward price (pure margin step, curve-generation lives in `sim/`)

- `simulation/run_phase2a.py` — Phase 2a: 6-customer run with SME segment (PC3 shape), Context Handshake (RiskCommitteeMonitor + risk_committee_agent), scaled treasury £18,416.67, chronological term interleaving

**`interface/` — sim/saas seam**
- `interface/README.md`, `interface/contracts/.gitkeep` — seam scaffold (contracts not yet populated)

**`tools/`**
- `tools/delegate_ollama.py` — local-model delegation harness, routes to `qwen2.5-coder:14b` (code) or `qwen2.5:7b` (analysis/drafting) by task type

**`sim/`** (continued)
- `sim/profile_class_3.py` + `sim/data/profile_class_3_gad.csv` — PC3 (non-domestic unrestricted) GAD shape (fetched from UKERC/CEDA)
- `sim/risk_committee.py` — RiskCommitteeMonitor: treasury drawdown + VaR breach threshold checks, context packager
- `sim/risk_committee_agent.py` — frontier LLM risk committee agent (one lever: hedge_fraction, fired on threshold breach)
- `sim/cache_store.py` — lightweight JSON cache layer; background tasks pre-fetch, simulation checks before live API

**`background/`**
- `background/background_worker.py` — autonomous off-peak worker (Qwen only, no frontier tokens, pauses 16:00-19:00 GMT)
- `background/run_queued_tasks.py` — task dispatcher: reads background-tasks.md queue, runs via Ollama, logs performance + sends NTFY
- `background/start_worker.sh` — launches worker in detached tmux session

**`docs/`**
- `docs/simulation-period.md` — derivation of the 2016-01-01 → 2025-06-07 simulation window (P305 boundary)
- `docs/simulation-strategy.md` — companion to Phase 1d: hedging-strategy mechanics, what signal drove each evolution step, whether it improved
- `docs/phase0c-findings.md` — Phase 0c delegation-approach findings ("delegate everything" verdict)
- `docs/instructions/MASTER_BACKLOG.md` — the standing phase roadmap + NTFY/Phase-Summary/Delegation protocols (read at the start of every session)

- `docs/instructions/background-tasks.md` — background worker task queue (QUEUED/RUNNING/DONE)
- `docs/observability/PHASE_{1a,1b,1c,1d}_SUMMARY.md` — per-phase summaries (What was built / Key findings / Key decisions / Open questions / Token efficiency)
- `docs/observability/token-log.md` — running process-observability log (frontier vs local token spend, per session)

## Phase summary index
- Phase 0a/0b: no standalone summary doc — see `docs/instructions/MASTER_BACKLOG.md` "Where We Are" for the headline numbers (Q4 2016 P&L = −£77.67)
- Phase 0c: `docs/phase0c-findings.md` (full-year 2016 P&L = −£78.28; dissatisfaction counter; CLV seed)
- Phase 1a: `docs/observability/PHASE_1a_SUMMARY.md` (4-customer cohort + geography)
- Phase 1b: `docs/observability/PHASE_1b_SUMMARY.md` (9.5 years of real daily weather, 4 locations)
- Phase 1c: `docs/observability/PHASE_1c_SUMMARY.md` (forward-curve pricing fixes 2016 losses; surfaced the empty-book gap)
- Phase 1d: `docs/observability/PHASE_1d_SUMMARY.md` (agent-discovered hedging — converged to fully naked, "learned the wrong lesson from a calm period")
- Phase 1e: `docs/observability/PHASE_1e_SUMMARY.md` — capital physics run. Survived. Treasury £3,250→£9,114. Central hypothesis not confirmed: capital costs (37.6% of gross) didn't produce organic hedging. C1/C2 trapped at hf=0.00 (evolution rule blind at that boundary). C3/C4 held at 0.10. 2021 only net-loss year (-£154). 2023 σ_stressed regime shift tripled collateral — invisible to trapped agents.

## Open gates
- **Phase 1e** (`[REVIEW_GATE]`, SUPERSEDED by Rich's Phase 2 instruction): Context Handshake was chosen as the escape mechanism. Phase 2a is now in progress.
- **Phase 2a** (`[REVIEW_GATE]`, LIVE): Three headline findings: (1) C6 (warehouse, 45k kWh) net −£1,176 — capital costs exceed gross margin at flat-margin pricing; (2) Context Handshake fired 200+ times but all 401 — API key not in subprocess env; (3) VaR trigger too sensitive (fires every ~30 days even during healthy growth periods). Two fixes required before Phase 2b: API key mechanism for subprocesses, VaR threshold recalibration (1.20 → ~2.0). Full write-up: `docs/observability/PHASE_2a_SUMMARY.md`.
