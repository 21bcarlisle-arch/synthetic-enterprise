"""`site/data/value_arms.json` must be able to say "we could not read it" and "it is worth nothing".

THE DEFECT THIS GUARDS. The feed exists to publish a comparison whose honest answer is currently
NEGATIVE -- the per-customer arm's advantage is the price level, and the choosing is worth
-£571.38 on the SETTLED-REALISED clock (restated 2026-08-28; the superseded settled-provisioned
reading of the same run was -£174.57, and both are published side by side because deleting the
flattering one would leave a reader unable to size what the clock repair moved). Note the
restatement went AGAINST the arm, which is the result and not a cue to touch it (R12).

Two failure modes would each destroy that reading while leaving a green, plausible,
fully-populated file behind:

  FAIL-OPEN ON THE POPULATION -- an unreadable or half-written artefact rendering as £0 rather
  than as an absence. "The selection leg is worth nothing" and "we could not read the file" are
  the two sentences this whole surface exists to keep apart, and a zero renders them identically.

  A CLAIM THAT ROTS -- "the supplier this site publishes IS the flat-rules baseline" is true today
  because the published run and the A/B's control arm are the same run. The site republishes every
  run. So the claim is recomputed from the published run's own `total_net_gbp` every time, and it
  must render as its own NEGATIVE the moment the two diverge.

R15 -- the mutations, each run and reverted:
  * make `_read` return `{}` instead of None on a malformed artefact -> the available=False tests
    red (the feed would publish an empty comparison).
  * default `_f` to 0.0 instead of None -> `test_a_missing_figure_is_absent_not_zero` reds.
  * widen SAME_SUPPLIER_TOLERANCE_GBP to 1e9 -> `test_a_divergent_published_run_is_reported_as_a
    _divergence` reds.
  * route the level arm by WHICH BLOCK it was found in rather than by the clock the block declares
    -> `test_a_split_on_the_superseded_clock_withholds_the_level_arm` reds (this is the mutation
    that would re-publish superseded figures under the realised heading the day the tool changed).
  * widen the split-vs-bridge agreement check to accept a clock-sized gap ->
    `test_a_split_that_disagrees_with_the_bridge_withholds_the_level_arm` reds.
  * report `stdev: 0.0` when no noise floor exists -> `test_a_missing_noise_floor_is_an_absent
    _error_bar_not_a_spread_of_zero` reds.
The null rungs -- the real artefacts, which must stay fully available with every figure present --
are `test_the_real_artefacts_publish_all_three_arms` and its siblings, and they stay green under
all five.
